# Integrated Gradients for DL Feature Attribution

This repo contains an implementation of *Integrated Gradients (IG)* for explaining feature importance in DL models.

## Features
- Computes *Integrated Gradients* for recurrent and static features.
- Supports *LSTM models* with time-series and static inputs.
- *Heatmap visualizations* for better interpretability.
